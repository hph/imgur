With imgur you can take screenshots after a specified time interval and upload
images to [imgur.com](http://imgur.com). By executing `imgur` in the terminal
(without any options) the program will wait for three seconds, take a
screenshot and uplaod it to [imgur.com](http://imgur.com). The url to the image
will be displayed when finished. There are several options available. Some of
them being:
* `-c`: save the output to the clipboard
* `-s`: specify the time interval (`-s 0` takes a screenshot instantly)
* `-n`: do not upload the image
