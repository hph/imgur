imgur
=====
With imgur you can take screenshots after a specified time interval and/or
upload images to imgur.com. By executing `imgur` in the terminal, without any
options, the program will wait for three seconds and then take a screenshot and
uplaod it to imgur.com. The url to the image will be displayed when finished.
You can make it save the output to the clipboard with the `-c` option and
specify the time interval with `-s` (0 takes a screenshot instantly, any other
integer waits that many seconds). If you don't want the images uploaded, you
can use `-n`.
